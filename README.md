🚀 Getting Started
1. Environment Setup
This project has been tested with Python 3.12. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
2. Configuration
To connect with external services (e.g., Google APIs), ensure you have your credentials.json and token.json files in the root directory. Note that these files are ignored by git to protect your sensitive data.

3. Running the Project
To run the latest version of the AI, use the following command:

Bash
python V6.py
📝 Update History
Detailed change logs are maintained in the UpdateLog.txt file.
